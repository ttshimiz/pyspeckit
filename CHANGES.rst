Version 0.1.19 (2016-06-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Enhancement #170: Added a ``cold_ammonia`` model, which uses a specific
      set of approximations to fit the rotational temperature and retrieve the
      kinetic temperature
    * Bugfix #166: Spectrum objects should, and now do, inherit the registry
      from their parents.  This is critical for fitting non-default models to
      cubes
    * Bugfix #163: Allow parameter cubes that have NaNs to be loaded
    * Enhancement #161: Cleaned up moment-specified guesses for cubes
    * Enhancement #160: Added multiply ionized RRLs to the RRL models
    * Enhancement #156: NaN pixels are treated as though they were masked out
      (previously, numpy masked arrays had to be used for this functionality)
    * Bugfix #154: pyspeckit script upgraded to py3 compatible
    * Bugfix #152: SpectroscopicAxis comparisons did not properly yield
      booleans due to an inheritance error.
    * Bugfix #147: Spectrum arithmetic was being allowed between spectrum
      objects with different X-axes.  This has been disallowed, and a test has
      been added.
    * Enhancement #147: ``from_spectrum1d`` implemented to instantiate a
      ``pyspeckit.Spectrum`` from a ``specutils.Spectrum1D`` object
    * Bugfix #128: fiteach would try to measure an integral even if the
      spectral fit failed
    * MAJOR bugfix #136: There was an error in the equation used to create the
      Ammonia model that would result in fits reporting incorrect values of the
      column density.  The Ammonia model has been substantially refactored,
      removing the ``thin`` option in favor of putting the thin approximation
      into its own function.

Version 0.1.18.1 (2015-12-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * MAJOR bugfix #125: Discovered a major issue introduced in #122 in which a
      typo in the radiative transfer equation results in an incorrect model

Version 0.1.18 (2015-12-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major change: this is the first version of pyspeckit fully compatible with
python3.

    * Bugfixes: #92, #93 related to fiteach, parameter validation,
      spectroscopic axis array handling, in_range checks, and the ammonia fit
      and plot wrapper.  Also includes an update to the versioning scheme such
      that dev versions (like 0.1.18.dev) will include a git devstring when
      possible.
    * Bugfix #91: Offset of 0.13 km/s between ammonia frequency used and that
      in the LOVAS catalog
    * Bugfix #90: Allow fitting of multiple peaks interactively (again)
    * Enhancement #89: Allow data to be passed to Spectrum as a quantity
    * Bugfix #88: line_ids needed to handle quantities
    * Enhancement #85: Remove hard-coded T_A* label
    * Bugfix #82: Fix a loophole in which parameters were not checked for being
      in bounds when passed as `guesses`
    * Addition #99: fiteach example with NIR data cubes, specfit example using
      user-created model, and a guide to installing pyspeckit via GitHub.
    * Enhancement #100: Display EQW highlighting at appropriate location
    * Addition #102: New N2D+ model
    * Bugfix #105: Ammonia thin works (though it is still not recommended)
    * Bugfix #106: Baselines were dependent on the X-axis coordinate unit.
    * Enhancement #108, 110, 111, 112: Python 3 compatibility
    * Bugfix #113: Improved plotting & robustness of measure_fwhm, especially
      when baseline is not subtracted
    * Bugfix #115: py3ify steppify
    * Enhancement #117/#119: Better error messages when using
      ``SpectralCube.load_model`` and more robust figure (re-)opening (if you
      closed a figure created by spectral cube and then tried to plot again, it
      would result in a crash.  This behavior was never supported, so it is not
      a bugfix, but now the behavior should work)
    * Bugfix #118: Re-fitting within a given window sometimes failed, possibly
      due to how matplotlib handles event handlers.  Refactoring should make
      this much more robust.
    * Enhancement #120: astropy-helpers + travis-ci related infrastructure
      update
    * Bugfix #121: Use correct variable name in N2D+ degeneracy
    * Bugfix #122: Informative errors on file reading & exact RT equation in
      ``hyperfine`` model
    * Addition #124: LTE model

Version 0.1.17 (2015-07-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Bugfixes: #67, #69, #71, #74, #75 related to fiteach
    * Bugfix for error bar plotting (PR #76, issue #78)
    * Documentation cleanup and enhancement (#77)

Release 0.1.16 (2015-05-21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Major refactor: use astropy's Quantity and units to replace pyspeckit's
      minimalist unit framework.  You may see deprecation warnings as a result!
      (https://github.com/pyspeckit/pyspeckit/pull/26)
    * The refactor led to many subsequent bugfixes: #61, #55, #51, and others
    * Removal of the `peakbgfit` default method: instead, the default is to treat
      all fits as multifits.  Changes came from #32, #25
    * New ammonia models (#28, #50): absorption against a background source and
      treating each line independently without a temperature connecting them

Release 0.1.15 (2014-11-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Bugfix: write_fit is part of Cube, not CubeStack
    * Bugfix: excludefit must occur after selectregion if fit_plotted_area is True
    * API change: For the fitter & baseliner, data selection is end-inclusive
                  if specified in world coordinates
    * Bugfix: numpy 1.8 added a "writeable" flag that broke units; that is now 
              corrected
              http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flags.html
    * Baseline: add a `fit` method that is independent from `button2action` to
      make masking and fitting independent processes

    * Converted to astropy-helper template for setup
    * Changed 'units' -> 'unit' in Spectrum

Release 0.1.14 (2013-09-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Bugfix: integral(direct=True) double-subtracted the baseline if it was
              already subtracted

                   Gaussian so far)

    * Added cross-correlation

    * Subtle but very significant bug-fix: parinfo is now a single uniform
      list, based on the ParinfoList class.
    * You can now fit based on what you see by using the 'use_window_limits=True' kwarg
      .. warning:: This changes the default behavior in interactive mode!
