Ammonia Models
==============

The Ammonia modeling tools include a set of constants in the
``ammonia_constants`` module and the following ammonia modeling tools
listed below.

There is also an ammonia fitter wrapper; see :doc:`wrappers`.

Note that there are two modules described here: the multi-rotational-transition
fitter, which has its own set of custom functions, and a generic hyperfine-line
fitting module meant to fit a single metastable (or non-metastable) transition.
